<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To complete the challenges and build this project you'll need a basic understanding of JavaScript. You can start by completing the #100Devs [JavaScript Basics: Classes 12-14](https://communitytaught.org/class/learn-javascript) courses.

You can [download the project](https://github.com/RjayBrown/javascript-dom-intro/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone and [run the project locally](https://github.com/RjayBrown/javascript-dom-intro#clone--run-locally) to get hands-on practice with the core concepts below.

### Core Concepts

- HTML: List Types & Displaying Images
- CSS: Page Themes & Navigation
- JavaScript: DOM Elements & Event Listeners
- Forms: Validating User Inputs

### Review & Practice

Start in the practice folder, and after reviewing the code and comments in each file, try adding hover styles to the navigation links. Next, since the navigation menu is too wide for mobile devices, you will need to build a working mobile menu. For an extra challenge, try adding a button that toggles the page theme from light to dark (as pictured in the screenshots) and building an input field allowing the user to add items to each list. There is a hint that points you in the right direction, you may need to use your resources and searching skills to figure it out!

## Build a Mini-Project

Once you complete the courses and challenges you'll have the skills to build a basic landing page featuring a sign-up form offering free trials to your potential customers!!! Have fun, be creative, and think of any product or service you like! You can use any of the Canva designs [here](https://www.canva.com/website-builder/templates/landing-page/) for inspiration. Your site can be a single page or multiple pages, but it should have at least a light/dark theme and display a helpful error message if the user's input is not valid. The starter files are in the practice folder.

If you run into trouble, you can reach out in the #100Devs [[❓code-help]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735925942559440997) channel on Discord. It's an amazing community space filled with supportive developers happy to answer any questions you have!

## Clone & Run Locally

1. Open the terminal in your code editor and type (or copy/paste):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RjayBrown/javascript-dom-intro
   ```

   - _**NOTE:** You can also click the green code button and copy the url (make sure HTTPS is selected)_

2. Navigate to the project folder

   ```
   cd javascript-dom-intro
   ```

You are now able to access and run the project locally.
